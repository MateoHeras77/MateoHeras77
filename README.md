# Hi, I'm Mateo! ðŸ‘‹

  I am Wilmer Mateo Heras Vera, from Cuenca, Ecuador and I am in the process of becoming a data scientist.

## ðŸš€ About Me

I am currently a senior student of economics at the 
University of Cuenca, where I was a student representative. 
I held the position of League President of the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences for 1 year. I also provided support to the student association of the school of economics. 
In addition, I support my educational level with different courses of Machine Learning, Microsoft Office, SQL, Business Intelligence and Statistics through MOOCS courses (UDEMY, EDX, COURSERA, etc).  
On the other hand, from a very early age I was an athlete, being my favorite sport basketball. I had the opportunity to represent my school, college, university and the province of Azuay in national and international championships.
